# MATLAB_ED_BHM

This project compiles some functions written in MATLAB and are used for exact diagonalization simulation of 1D, bose-hubbard systems to compare with exeperiments of bosonic atoms in optical lattices in quantum gas microscopes. Note that this then implies all simulations performed by the basic functions in this code are inherently for closed systems since they will have only unitary dynamics.
